The MovieLens 1M dataset originates from GroupLens Research, 
a research group at the University of Minnesota. It was 
collected through the MovieLens website (movielens.org)

Another dataset you can use with the Surprise library is "ml-1m" 
(MovieLens 1M). This dataset contains 1 million movie ratings from users

Module loads a built-in dataset provided by the Surprise library. 
In this case, it loads the "MovieLens 100k" dataset (ml-100k), which 
contains 100,000 movie ratings from users.
If the dataset is not already downloaded, the function will prompt the
 user to download it and store it in a directory (typically .surprise_data 
 in the user's home folder.
